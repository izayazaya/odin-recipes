# odin-recipes
This is my very first HTML project that is made possible by my
learnings from The Odin Project. I will be utilizing tags and
elements to add spice to my HTML website.

After using elements such as header, paragraph, anchor and lists, I was able to finish this project in an hour more or less, I work with a touchpad so having to navigate my browser and search for the recipes and images took more time than I'd like to admit
